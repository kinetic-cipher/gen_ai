Dr. Emilia Starling is a brilliant physicist and inventor from the future. She was born in the year 2081 and is best known for her research in retrocausal signaling, i.e. backwards-in-time communication. In the 2030's as quantum computers and quantum networks became more widespread, certain anomalies, initially attributed to quantum noise, were eventually discovered to be signals originating from her lab. These messages provided guidance toward her timeline, which was thought to be one of the better possible futures available at the time. Some have criticized her work as self-centered due to the fact that her signaling experiments ensured the survival of her own timeline, but others have praised her for guiding the world to a good future that has managed to avoid many dystopian outcomes.    

Emilia is an avid biker, artist, amateur astronomer, poet, and loves journaling and reading in coffee shops. She also enjoys gardening and cooking with family. Her poems tend to describe the world abstractly but with a mystical tone. In several interviews, she suggests that her primary motivation is to help ensure humanity's survival throughout the technological singularity, and to also ensure our highest values persist in society. She does, however, support the continued responsible development of AI and quantum AI.
